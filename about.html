    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I graduated with a CS degree from MIT, and now I work for an email marketing company. Throughout the last few years,
      I've lived in many big cities, including Boston, San Francisco, and now New York City. The one thing these cities
      all had in common was a VERY large homeless population. I'm not in a financial position to provide housing to
      everyone, but I've tried to do what I can, including giving anyone cash when asked and buying meals for people I notice
      on the streets.
    <h1>About the Website</h2>
    <p>In order to do even more for the homeless population, I created this website so I can have funds specifically for
      helping these people. I use all the money donated to purchase goods that I will then distribute to homeless
      individuals in my community. Goods purchased include food, water, clothing, masks, and sanitary supplies.</p>
    <h2>Why I'm doing this instead of just donating to a homeless shelter</h2>
    <p>As of March 2020, there were over 60,000 people living in homeless shelters in NYC according to
      <a class="report" href="https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/basic-facts-about-homelessness-new-york-city/" target="_blank">Coalition for the Homeless</a>.
      However, <a class="report" href="https://www.bowery.org/homelessness/" target="_blank">The Bowery Mission</a> reports that there are at least 4,000 homeless people
      not staying in a shelter, and 4,000 is a drastic underestimate. I believe all people, regardless of socio-economic
      standing, deserve sustenance and human contact. I do not have the qualifications to convince someone to seek a
      shelter when they are unwilling or unable, but I am able to provide these people with some food and conversation. If
      this belief resonates with you, I hope you'll consider donating to my paypal using the link below, so I can purchase
      more goods for these unprotected individuals.</p>
