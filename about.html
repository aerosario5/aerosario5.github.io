    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I graduated with a CS degree from MIT, and now I work for an email marketing company. Throughout the last few years,
      I've lived in many big cities, including Boston, San Francisco, and now New York City. The one thing these cities
      all had in common was a VERY large homeless population. I'm not in a financial position to provide housing to
      everyone, but I've tried to do what I can, including giving anyone cash when asked and buying meals for people I notice
      on the streets.
    <h2>About the Website</h2>
    <p>In order to do even more for the homeless population, I created this website so I can have funds specifically for
      helping these people. I use all the money donated to purchase goods that I will then distribute to homeless
      individuals in my community. Goods purchased include food, water, clothing, masks, and sanitary supplies.</p>
